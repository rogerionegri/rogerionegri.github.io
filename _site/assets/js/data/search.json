    "content": "SoftwaresMICEThe software M.I.C.E. (my Image Classification Environment) combines different techniques for image classification, segmentation, and simulation. Most of the implementations that make up this tool were carried out between 2014 and 2017, as a result of research on methods for classifying remote sensing images. Most implementations are supported by functions available in the SLIC library (Small Library for Image Classification) (Negri, 2013). Among some of the motivations that led to the development of this tool, the following are mentioned: (i) providing a tool useful for teaching and research; (ii) building an interface that is easily extensible for the inclusion of new methods for image classification, segmentation, and simulation; (iii) providing an organized set of image processing techniques with applications focused on remote sensing; (iv) carrying out simple procedures for image manipulation and statistical analysis of images.References  R.

National Institute for Space Research, 2013, p. 166.ManualRepositoryGeotexInspectorThe software GeotexInspector is the result of a research effort to investigate the pore size distribution (PSD) of nonwoven geotextiles using image-processing and pattern recognition techniques. The software was implemented between 2015 and 2017 with the use of functions available from the SLIC library (Small Library for Image Classification) (Negri, 2013). PSD curves estimated using GeotexInspector were published by Silva et al (2018). The development of the presently described software was galvanized by the following main goals: (i) to offer a robust (and free-to-use) tool for teaching and research purposes; (ii) to build a relatively simple interface with respect to the adjustment of parameters for the experimental analyses; (iii) to provide researchers and industry professionals with a quick yet accurate method to examine pore openings in nonwoven geotextiles, particularly when they are applied to filtration functions.References      R.

    "content": "Research and Development of Algorithms for Change Detection in Remote Sensing Imagery (FAPESP Grant #2018/01033-3)AbstractRemote Sensing has become an important tool for environmental processes analysis. Among several applications, change detection using Remote Sensing imagery is a topic of great interest. Perform this application in a temporal and accurate way is extremely important to understand the relations between anthropic and natural phenomena, allowing then better decision making. Use image classification as an intermediate step for change detection has been shown as an appropriate procedure. However, this approach depends on the accuracy of the classification results, which consequently motivates the development of more accurate classification methods. Based on the concept of divergence, stochastic distances have received great attention in recent years. In the light of this discussion, this project proposes the development of new change detection methods with basis on concepts derived from classification and stochastic distance able to produce robust and competitive results in comparison to conventional methodologies. Analysis with simulated data and practical applications will be carried in order to validate proposed methods.PublicationsUnder construction…"

Remote Sensing image classification is one of the most important applications of Pattern Recognition in environmental studies. Face to the importance of achieve more accurate classification results, develop and enhance image classification techniques is a constant motivation. The emergence of kernel functions has revolutionized Pattern Recognition researches and consequently image classification application, further expanding the research area. This project proposes the study and development of new kernel functions for image classification, aiming to produce more accurate results compared to usual kernels.
