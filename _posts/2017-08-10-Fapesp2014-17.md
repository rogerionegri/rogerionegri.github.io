# Project: Study and Development of New Kernel Functions with Applications on Remote Sensing Image Classification (FAPESP Grant #2014/14830-8)

## Abstract

Pattern Recognition is a Computer Science area which aims to deal with classification problems. Remote Sensing image classification is one of the most important applications of Pattern Recognition in environmental studies. Face to the importance of achieve more accurate classification results, develop and enhance image classification techniques is a constant motivation. The emergence of kernel functions has revolutionized Pattern Recognition researches and consequently image classification application, further expanding the research area. This project proposes the study and development of new kernel functions for image classification, aiming to produce more accurate results compared to usual kernels. The validation of the kernels developed from this research will be done using simulated images and practical studies about land use and land cover classification in Brazilian Amazon.
