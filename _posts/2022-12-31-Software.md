# Softwares

## MICE

The software M.I.C.E. (my Image Classification Environment) combines different techniques for image classification, segmentation, and simulation. Most of the implementations that make up this tool were carried out between 2014 and 2017, as a result of research on methods for classifying remote sensing images. Most implementations are supported by functions available in the SLIC library (Small Library for Image Classification) (Negri, 2013). Among some of the motivations that led to the development of this tool, the following are mentioned: (i) providing a tool useful for teaching and research; (ii) building an interface that is easily extensible for the inclusion of new methods for image classification, segmentation, and simulation; (iii) providing an organized set of image processing techniques with applications focused on remote sensing; (iv) carrying out simple procedures for image manipulation and statistical analysis of images.

## GeotexInspector

The software GeotexInspector is the result of a research effort to investigate the pore size distribution (PSD) of nonwoven geotextiles using image-processing and pattern recognition techniques. The software was implemented between 2015 and 2017 with the use of functions available from the SLIC library (Small Library for Image Classification) (Negri, 2013). PSD curves estimated using GeotexInspector were published by Silva et al (2018). The development of the presently described software was galvanized by the following main goals: (i) to offer a robust (and free-to-use) tool for teaching and research purposes; (ii) to build a relatively simple interface with respect to the adjustment of parameters for the experimental analyses; (iii) to provide researchers and industry professionals with a quick yet accurate method to examine pore openings in nonwoven geotextiles, particularly when they are applied to filtration functions.
